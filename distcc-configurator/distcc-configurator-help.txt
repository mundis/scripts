The usage of distcc-configurator is quite simple. Instead of adding the distccd using "rc-update add distccd default"
to the default runlevel, you have to add distcc-configurator with "rc-update add distcc-configurator default"

now you can start and stop distcc and the configurator via the commands
	distcc-configurator start
	distcc-configurator stop
	distcc-configurator restart
	distcc-configurator reconfigure

the reconfigure option is used if you want to restart and reconfiguring all computers where distcc-configurator is started
